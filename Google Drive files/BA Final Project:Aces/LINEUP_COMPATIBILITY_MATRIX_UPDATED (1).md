| Pairing | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Notes |
|---------|---------|------|------|---------|-------|
| Gray + Smith | +7.9 | 112.2 | 104.3 | 10,050 | Gray facilitates Smith's interior game |
| Gray + Loyd | +6.1 | 111.3 | 105.2 | 9,920 | Ball security duo; Loyd covers Gray's TOV% |

---

### CAUTION ZONE (0.0 to +4.9 Net Rating)

| Pairing | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Warning |
|---------|---------|------|------|---------|---------|
| Gray + Nye | **+0.3** | 112.2 | 111.9 | 7,809 | ⚠️ Defensive liability - opponents score freely |
| Loyd + Evans | **-0.6** | 102.4 | 103.0 | 9,840 | ⚠️ Ball movement problems; neither creates |
| Loyd + Nye | **-0.9** | 108.0 | 108.8 | 7,068 | ⚠️ Neutral impact; limited upside |

**Coaching Rule:** Limit these pairings to <8 minutes per game. Never in crunch time.

---

### AVOID ZONE (-1.0 to -9.9 Net Rating)

| Pairing | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|------|---------|------|
| Gray + Evans | **-1.3** | 108.6 | 109.9 | 7,960 | 🔴 Turnover cascade; redundant roles |
| Evans + Bell | **-2.1** | 90.9 | 93.0 | 3,600 | 🔴 Spacing illusion - high 3PT rate, low conversion |
| Smith + Nye | **-6.4** | 98.1 | 104.5 | 2,860 | 🔴 No creation; offense stagnates |

**Coaching Rule:** Use only in garbage time or desperate situations. Maximum 4-6 minutes together.

---

### NEVER PLAY TOGETHER (<-10.0 Net Rating)

| Pairing | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Impact |
|---------|---------|------|------|---------|--------|
| **Evans + Nye** | **-12.2** | 92.5 | 104.7 | 8,320 | 🚨 **DISASTER** - 20 points per 100 worse than average |
| **Bell + Nye** | **-15.4** | 83.8 | 99.2 | 2,546 | 🚨 **CATASTROPHIC** - 83.8 ORtg destroys offense |

**CRITICAL RULE:** These pairings cost the team ~15-20 points per 100 possessions. Under NO circumstances should Evans and Nye share the court, even in garbage time (reinforces bad habits).

---

## THREE-PLAYER COMBINATIONS (PBPSTATS DATA)

### ELITE TRIOS (100+ Minutes, +15.0 or Better Net Rating)

| Trio | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Use Case |
|------|---------|------|------|---------|----------|
| Evans + Bell + Smith | **+36.8** | 116.1 | 79.4 | 340 | Small sample but devastating defense |
| Loyd + Wilson + Bell | **+34.8** | 120.3 | 85.5 | 650 | Spacing + rim protection + ball security |
| Gray + Evans + Bell | **+34.7** | 118.1 | 83.3 | 440 | Gray unlocks Evans and Bell offensively |
| Wilson + Evans + Bell | **+31.6** | 102.9 | 71.3 | 500 | Elite defense with Wilson anchoring |

| Wilson + Young + Nye | **+19.0** | 113.3 | 94.4 | 2,079 | Elite duo elevates Nye |
| **Wilson + Young + Gray** | **+14.3** | 115.1 | 100.8 | **9,460** | **CHAMPIONSHIP CORE - Highest minutes** |

**Key Insight:** The Core 3 (Wilson+Young+Gray) played 9,460 minutes together at +14.3 - this is the championship foundation. But smaller trios with elite players can outperform in short bursts.

### WORST TRIOS (100+ Minutes)

| Trio | Net Rtg | ORtg | DRtg | Minutes | Why It Fails |
|------|---------|------|------|---------|--------------|
| Loyd + Bell + Nye | **-32.3** | 81.1 | 113.3 | 333 | No creation, no defense, no hope |
| Gray + Evans + Nye | **-22.0** | 99.0 | 121.0 | 1,630 | Defensive disaster; 121.0 DRtg unacceptable |
| Evans + Bell + Nye | **-20.1** | 78.9 | 99.0 | 1,050 | 78.9 ORtg = worst offensive trio |
| Loyd + Smith + Nye | **-17.5** | 89.8 | 107.4 | 576 | No playmaking whatsoever |
| Loyd + Evans + Nye | **-10.2** | 94.8 | 105.1 | 2,070 | Extended minutes = guaranteed deficit |
| Gray + Smith + Nye | **-10.6** | 106.7 | 117.3 | 783 | Gray can't save this defensive pairing |

**CRITICAL:** Any trio with TWO of (Evans, Bell, Nye) together produces catastrophic results. The "bench trio" of Evans+Bell+Nye posted a -20.1 Net Rating in 1,050 minutes.

---

## FOUR-PLAYER COMBINATIONS (50+ Minutes)

### BEST FOUR-PLAYER GROUPS

| Four Players | Net Rtg | Minutes | Notes |
|--------------|---------|---------|-------|
| Gray + Evans + Bell + Smith | **+97.8** | 52 | Small sample explosion |
| Loyd + Wilson + Evans + Bell | **+60.4** | 76 | Wilson elevates bench players |
| Gray + Loyd + Evans + Bell | **+49.3** | 92 | Surprising offensive punch |
| Wilson + Young + Evans + Bell | **+41.7** | 156 | Elite core + spacing |
| Loyd + Wilson + Young + Bell | **+37.5** | 240 | Top 4 rotation without Gray |
| Wilson + Young + Evans + Smith | **+31.6** | 208 | Twin Towers variant |
| Loyd + Wilson + Young + Nye | **+30.9** | 420 | Highest minutes elite-4 |

---

### WORST FOUR-PLAYER GROUPS

| Four Players | Net Rtg | Minutes | NEVER USE |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Loyd + Young + Smith + Nye | **-50.5** | 56 | 🚨 Elite players can't save Nye here |
| Gray + Loyd + Smith + Nye | **-48.2** | 104 | 🚨 Two elite + two negative = disaster |
| Gray + Evans + Smith + Nye | **-44.7** | 104 | 🚨 Gray overwhelmed by defensive holes |
| Loyd + Evans + Bell + Nye | **-36.1** | 108 | 🚨 Four negative players together |
| Gray + Young + Evans + Nye | **-33.8** | 104 | 🚨 Even Core 2 can't save this |
| Gray + Loyd + Evans + Nye | **-30.7** | 328 | 🚨 Extended minutes = guaranteed loss |

**COACHING RULE:** Never play any four-player group with 2+ of (Evans, Bell, Nye) together unless Wilson or Young is also present.

## PLAYER ON/OFF IMPACT ANALYSIS (PBPSTATS DETAILED)

### OFFENSIVE IMPACT (Pts per 100 Possessions)

| Player | Team ON | Team OFF | Differential | Rank |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|------|
| **A'ja Wilson** | 112.9 | 93.3 | **+19.6** | #1 |

### DEFENSIVE IMPACT (Pts per 100 Possessions Allowed)

| Player | Team ON | Team OFF | Differential | Rank |
|--------|---------|----------|--------------|------|
| **A'ja Wilson** | 100.4 | 110.2 | **-9.8** | #1 |

| Aaliyah Nye | 105.4 | 102.0 | **+3.4** | #7 |
| Chelsea Gray | 104.6 | 98.2 | **+6.5** | #8 |

**SURPRISE FINDING:** Kierstan Bell is the #2 defensive player despite offensive struggles! Wilson remains the defensive anchor, but Bell's -8.5 differential suggests she should play in defensive-focused lineups.

**Concern:** Gray's +6.5 defensive differential confirms her defensive weakness - opponents score 6.5 more points per 100 when she's on court.

## CRITICAL LINEUP RULES (UPDATED WITH DATA)

### ✅ ALWAYS DO

1. **Wilson + Young together in clutch** (+13.6 Net, 22,260 minutes proven)
2. **Core 3 for 28-30 MPG minimum** (+14.3 Net in 9,460 minutes)
3. **Bell in defensive-focused lineups** (-8.5 defensive differential!)
4. **Gray + Loyd for ball security** (+6.1 Net, complementary skills)
5. **Wilson to stabilize struggling players** (elevates Bell to +16.2, Nye to +12.7)

### ❌ NEVER DO

1. **Evans + Nye together** (-12.2 Net in 8,320 minutes - CATASTROPHIC)
2. **Bell + Nye together** (-15.4 Net, 83.8 ORtg - offense dies)
3. **Any trio with 2+ of Evans/Bell/Nye** (consistent -15 to -30 Net)
4. **Gray + Evans together in close games** (-1.3 Net, turnover cascade)
5. **Four-player groups with 2+ bench players without Wilson/Young anchor**

### ⚠️ MONITOR CLOSELY

1. **Gray's defensive assignments** (+6.5 defensive liability)
2. **Bell's offensive role** (spot-up only, don't let her create)
3. **Smith's pace impact** (-3.8 slows game significantly)
4. **Evans in any lineup without Wilson anchor** (team -11.1 when he's primary)

---

## SUBSTITUTION OPTIMIZATION

### When Gray Gets Tired (30+ MPG)
**Replace with:** Loyd  
**Data Support:** Gray + Loyd = +6.1; Loyd provides ball security

### When Wilson Needs Rest (32+ MPG)
**Replace with:** Smith + increase Gray/Young usage  
**Data Support:** Smith + any elite = +9 to +12 Net  
**Warning:** Team drops 20 points per 100 without Wilson

### Foul Trouble Protocol
- **Wilson 3+ fouls before 4th:** Sit immediately; Smith to 28+ MPG
- **Young 3+ fouls:** Sit; Loyd enters (+9.0 with Young when back)
- **Gray 4+ fouls + 4+ TOs:** Young becomes primary PG

---

## CONCLUSION: THE DATA-DRIVEN MANDATE

The pbpstats data is unequivocal:

1. **A'ja Wilson is irreplaceable** - +19.6 offensive AND -9.8 defensive differential
2. **The Core 3 is championship-caliber** - +14.3 Net in 9,460 minutes of proof
3. **Evans + Nye is the worst pairing in the league** - -12.2 Net in 8,320 minutes
4. **Bell is a defensive asset** - -8.5 differential, use in defensive lineups
5. **Gray is an offensive engine with defensive concerns** - +19.6 offense, +6.5 defense allowed

**Final Mandate:** Maximize Wilson/Young/Gray minutes together. Never pair Evans with Nye. Use Bell defensively. Trust the data.
