Now that you have the appropriate context for my class final project, let's do a bit of work on building team datasets and charts. I have team box scores and pbp and schedules for the WNBA, 2023-2025 (team box scores and schedule datasets are attached to project via GitHub for your reference, especially when building scripts reference these files to obtain the proper field names being used). 

As per my final project guidelines, main team aspects I should focus on are general team tactical/strategic adjustments. This past 2025 season, the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces started the season with a 14-14 record. They then went on a 17-game winning streak that continued into the playoffs. The streak ended in Game 2 of the first-round playoff series when the Seattle Storm defeated the Aces 86-83, forcing a deciding Game 3\.

After the Game 2 loss, the Aces rallied to win the rest of their playoff games, including a four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury in the WNBA Finals, winning their third championship title in four years (2022, 2023, 2025). This historic season needs to be examined within my final project. 

My storytelling angle \- team performance by phase. Segment the season into at least three phases using the schedule:

* Phase 1: “Rocky” start – games 1–28 (14–14 record)  
* Phase 2: 16-game win streak to end the regular season \- games 29-44 (from 15–14 to 30–14 record)  
* Phase 3: Playoffs run with a mini-focus on  
  * Pre-loss Playoff Game 1 vs Storm (win streak extended to 17\)  
  * Game 2 @ Storm (86–83 loss that snapped the streak)  
  * All remaining playoff games including the 4–0 Finals sweep of Phoenix Mercury

A few key questions to anchor and focus in on:

1\) How did the Aces’ team profile at 14–14 differ from their profile during the 16–0 close to the regular season and the title run? 

2\) Which four-factor levers (shooting, turnovers, rebounding, free throws) and lineup/rotation decisions changed most during the streak? 

3\) How did the Aces’ strengths/weaknesses compare to league benchmarks during the slump vs during the title run? 

Purpose: Compare slump vs streak vs playoffs in a more analytical way. Help me develop and build this team analysis section for my final project. I should calculate advanced metrics, derived metrics, four factors if necessary (using Dean Oliver formulas for calculations), benchmarks like league averages, percentiles by position, rankings, etc.
