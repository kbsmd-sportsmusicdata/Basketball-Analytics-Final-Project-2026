**Games:** 52 | **MPG:** 32.3 | **2018 Draft:** #1 overall

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **PER** | 33.1 | **100th** | **100th** | Elite |
| **Win Shares** | 8.9 | **100th** | **100th** | Elite |
| **True Shooting %** | 58.3% | **89th** | 87th | |
| **Assist %** | 19.8% | **100th** | 73rd | Elite (for C) |
| **Turnover %** | 9.9% | **95th** | 89th | Elite |
| **Total Rebound %** | 19.1% | **93rd** | 90th | Elite |
| **Steal %** | 2.3% | **95th** | 90th | Elite |
| **Defensive Rating** | 93.3 | **94th** | 97th | Elite |
| **Usage Rate** | 31.4% | Elite | Elite | |

### On/Off Court Impact
- **When ON:** ORtg 112.9 | DRtg 100.4 | NetRtg +12.4
- **When OFF:** ORtg 93.3 | DRtg 110.2 | NetRtg -16.9
- **Differential:** **+29.3 net rating** (best on team by 6.8 points)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Primary scorer and hub:** 31.4% usage rate with 58.3% true shooting – elite volume efficiency
- **Surprising playmaker:** 100th percentile assist rate among centers (19.8%) makes her a post facilitator
- **Midrange mastery:** 71.5% of shots from midrange (anti-analytics), but converts at elite rates
- **Free throw generator:** Gets to the line frequently, converts at solid 73% clip

**Defensive Anchor:**
- **Rim protection:** 94th percentile defensive rating – opponents avoid the paint when she's present
- **Versatility:** Can guard 4s and 5s, elite steal rate (95th percentile) shows perimeter awareness
- **Rebounding dominance:** 93rd percentile total rebounding rate, controls defensive glass

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs floor spacing:** Benefits from Chelsea Gray's elite playmaking (89th percentile AST%) setting her up
- **Creates for others:** Her gravity in the post opens perimeter shots for Bell and Nye
- **Carries offensive load:** Team's ORtg drops 19.6 points per 100 possessions when she sits

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Maximize minutes:** 32-34 MPG in important games – team cannot function without her
2. **Post-ups in flow:** Don't force isolation posts – let her work off Gray's penetration
3. **Early offense touches:** Get her involved early (first 3-4 possessions) to establish rhythm
4. **Rest strategically:** Only sit her when ahead by 12+ and never more than 4-5 consecutive minutes
5. **Leverage passing:** Use her high-low game with NaLyssa Smith – both are skilled passers

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- None from percentile analysis – truly has no statistical weaknesses
- **Health/fatigue** is only concern at 32+ MPG in year 8

## 2. JACKIE YOUNG - Elite Two-Way Star

**Position:** G | **Height:** 6'0" | **Experience:** 7 years (Veteran)  
**Games:** 56 | **MPG:** 31.4 | **2019 Draft:** #1 overall

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **PER** | 22.1 | **100th** | 92nd | Elite |
| **Win Shares** | 6.3 | **98th** | 94th | Elite |
| **True Shooting %** | 60.3% | **94th** | 84th | Elite |
| **Free Throw %** | 87.8% | **91st** | 93rd | Elite |
| **Assist %** | 28.1% | 85th | 89th | |
| **Usage Rate** | 23.3% | High | High | |
| **Defensive Rating** | 102.5 | 60th | 49th | |

### On/Off Court Impact
- **When ON:** ORtg 110.5 | DRtg 101.3 | NetRtg +9.2
- **When OFF:** ORtg 96.3 | DRtg 109.6 | NetRtg -13.3
- **Differential:** **+22.5 net rating** (2nd-best on team)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Secondary scoring option:** 16.5 PPG on elite 60.3% true shooting (94th percentile among guards)
- **Balanced playmaker:** 28.1% assist rate (85th percentile) – can facilitate or score
- **Shot versatility:** Can score from all three levels, not dependent on one area
- **Clutch executor:** 91st percentile free throw shooting makes her reliable in late-game situations

**Defensive Excellence:**
- **Two-way impact:** While defensive rating is 60th percentile, provides elite perimeter defense
- **Switchability:** 6'0" size allows switching 1-3, valuable in playoff matchups
- **Defensive differential:** Team DRtg improves 8.2 points with her on court

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Complements A'ja perfectly:** Combined +51.8 net rating – the team's foundation
- **Covers Chelsea's weaknesses:** Elite ball security mitigates Gray's turnover issues (16th percentile)
- **Doesn't need the ball:** Can produce off-ball, making her lineup-flexible

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **High-leverage minutes:** Play with A'ja in all critical moments – their chemistry is elite
2. **Secondary ball-handler:** When Chelsea sits, Jackie should run point – 85th percentile AST% capable
3. **Defensive assignments:** Put her on opponent's best perimeter player in playoffs
4. **Free throws in clutch:** Seek fouls for her late-game (91st percentile FT%)
5. **Off-ball movement:** Use her cutting ability – doesn't need ball dominance to be effective

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- None significant – zero improvement areas flagged in analysis
- **Avoid overuse:** 31.4 MPG already high, monitor fatigue in second half of season

---

## 3. CHELSEA GRAY - Primary Ball Handler

**Position:** G | **Height:** 5'11" | **Experience:** 11 years (Star Veteran)  
**Games:** 56 | **MPG:** 32.1 | **2014 Draft:** #11 overall (R1)

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **Assist %** | 30.7% | **89th** | 91st | Near-Elite |
| **True Shooting %** | 56.3% | **82nd** | 76th | |
| **PER** | 15.3 | 67th | 53rd | |
| **Win Shares** | 3.7 | 74th | 70th | |
| **Turnover %** | 17.9% | **16th** | 8th | WEAKNESS |

### On/Off Court Impact
- **When ON:** ORtg 111.7 | DRtg 104.6 | NetRtg +7.1
- **When OFF:** ORtg 92.1 | DRtg 98.2 | NetRtg -6.1
- **Differential:** **+13.2 net rating** (3rd-best on team)
- **Critical split:** Offense +19.6 when on / Defense -6.5 when on (trade-off)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Floor general:** 89th percentile assist rate (30.7%) – sets up the entire offense
- **Pick-and-roll maestro:** Elite at reading defenses, finding A'ja and Jackie in flow
- **Moderate usage:** 17.0% usage allows her to facilitate without dominating possessions
- **Efficient scorer when needed:** 82nd percentile true shooting means she can score in a pinch

**Turnover Problem (CRITICAL):**
- **Major weakness:** 16th percentile turnover rate (17.9%) is significant concern
- **Explains defensive slippage:** Turnovers lead to transition opportunities for opponents (-6.5 DRtg impact)
- **Late-game risk:** In close games, her turnovers can swing momentum

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs ball security around her:** Jackie Young's 94th percentile turnover rate helps compensate
- **Benefits from A'ja's gravity:** Post double-teams create kick-out assists
- **Defensive liabilities:** Team DRtg worsens 6.5 points with her on court – needs defensive support

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Turnover reduction program:** Film sessions focused on:
   - Slowing down in transition
   - Earlier reads in pick-and-roll
   - Limiting high-risk cross-court passes
2. **Pair with ball-secure players:** Always have Jackie or Jewell Loyd (both 90th+ TOV%) alongside her
3. **Never with Dana Evans:** Evans has similar instability – turnover cascade risk
4. **Defensive scheming:** Hide her on weakest perimeter threat when possible
5. **Late-game management:** In final 2 minutes of close games, consider jackie as primary if Gray has 4+ TOs

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Single critical weakness:** Turnover rate (16th percentile) undermines elite playmaking
- **Defensive regression:** Age 31 in year 11 – expect continued defensive decline
- **Target for improvement:** Even modest improvement to 50th percentile TOV% would be massive

## 4. NALYSSA SMITH - Paint Presence

**Position:** F | **Height:** 6'2" | **Experience:** 4 years (Young)  
**Games:** 39 | **MPG:** 22.8 | **2022 Draft:** #2 overall (R1)

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **Block %** | 1.5% | **75th** | 82nd | |
| **Total Rebound %** | 11.7% | 61st | 76th | |
| **True Shooting %** | 58.8% | 52nd | 51st | |
| **PER** | 13.2 | 30th | 37th | |
| **Assist %** | 4.2% | **4th** | 7th | WEAKNESS |
| **Steal %** | 0.6% | **13th** | 9th | WEAKNESS |
| **Free Throw %** | 63.9% | **6th** | 5th | WEAKNESS |
| **3PT Attempt Rate** | 16.9% | **16th** | 14th | WEAKNESS |

### On/Off Court Impact
- **When ON:** ORtg 111.1 | DRtg 102.0 | NetRtg +9.1
- **When OFF:** ORtg 105.1 | DRtg 104.0 | NetRtg +1.1
- **Differential:** **+8.0 net rating** (4th-best on team)
- **Two-way rating:** +11.3 (Elite tier) – balanced offense and defense

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Paint scorer:** Efficient around basket (58.8% TS%) but limited offensive range
- **Second-chance specialist:** Works offensive glass, creates put-backs
- **Non-ball-handler:** 4th percentile assist rate – not a playmaker
- **Free throw concern:** 6th percentile FT% (63.9%) limits late-game value

**Defensive Contribution:**
- **Rim protection:** 75th percentile block rate – legitimate shot-blocker
- **Twin towers potential:** Pairs well with A'ja Wilson for paint dominance
- **Rebounding:** Solid but not elite – 61st percentile among forwards

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs perimeter creators:** Cannot create own shot, requires setup
- **Benefits from Kierstan Bell pairing:** Bell's 93rd percentile 3PT rate spaces floor for her posts
- **Defensive anchor for bench:** When starters rest, she provides stability (+8.0 net)

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Twin towers lineups:** Use with A'ja against size-heavy opponents (Minnesota, New York)
2. **Limited post-ups:** She's a finisher, not a creator – catch-and-finish only
3. **Avoid late-game free throws:** 6th percentile FT% means avoid intentional fouls
4. **Pair with playmakers:** Always on court with Chelsea or Jackie to set her up
5. **Rim-running emphasis:** Use in transition for easy baskets, not in half-court isolation

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Four significant weaknesses:** AST%, STL%, FT%, 3PT rate all below 16th percentile
- **Limited offensive versatility:** Interior only, no perimeter game
- **Fouling tendency:** Block attempts can lead to fouls – monitor foul trouble

## 5. JEWELL LOYD - Ball Security Specialist

**Position:** G | **Height:** 5'10" | **Experience:** 11 years (Star Veteran)  
**Games:** 56 | **MPG:** 28.6 | **2015 Draft:** #1 overall (R1)

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **Turnover %** | 8.8% | **93rd** | 89th | ELITE |
| **3PT Attempt Rate** | 50.4% | 77th | 83rd | |
| **True Shooting %** | 52.4% | 49th | 43rd | |
| **PER** | 13.4 | 53rd | 41st | |
| **Assist %** | 8.9% | **18th** | 38th | WEAKNESS |

### On/Off Court Impact
- **When ON:** ORtg 108.4 | DRtg 103.9 | NetRtg +4.5
- **When OFF:** ORtg 104.0 | DRtg 101.9 | NetRtg +2.1
- **Differential:** **+2.4 net rating** (5th-best on team)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Ball security elite:** 93rd percentile turnover rate (8.8%) – among best in league
- **Scoring threat:** 11.2 PPG provides secondary scoring
- **Three-point volume:** 77th percentile 3PT attempt rate – willing shooter
- **Limited playmaking:** 18th percentile assist rate (8.9%) – not a facilitator

**Defensive Contribution:**
- **Neutral impact:** On/off splits show minor defensive improvement when on court
- **Switchable:** 5'10" size allows guarding multiple positions

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Complements Chelsea Gray:** Her elite TOV% helps when paired with Gray's turnover issues
- **Not a primary option:** Best as 4th/5th option, not asked to create
- **Benefits from A'ja's gravity:** Open catch-and-shoot opportunities

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Pair with Chelsea Gray:** Their combination provides elite playmaking + elite security
2. **Catch-and-shoot emphasis:** Not a creator – design plays for her as a spot-up threat
3. **Late-game security:** In close games, use her ball-handling to protect leads
4. **Avoid high usage:** Keep usage moderate – efficiency drops with increased volume
5. **Never with Dana Evans:** Both low assist rates (18th + 45th percentile) = ball movement problems

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Limited playmaking:** 18th percentile assist rate means she can't run an offense
- **Efficiency concerns:** 49th percentile true shooting – not an elite scorer
- **Role clarity needed:** Best in defined spot-up/security role, not as primary ball-handler

---

## 6. DANA EVANS - Role Player

**Position:** G | **Height:** 5'6" | **Experience:** 5 years (Young)  
**Games:** 56 | **MPG:** 18.2 | **2021 Draft:** #13 overall (R2)

- **When OFF:** ORtg 112.0 | DRtg 102.8 | NetRtg +9.2
- **Differential:** **-12.3 net rating** (worst on team)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Secondary ball-handler:** 82nd percentile turnover rate (11.6%) shows solid handling
- **Bench playmaker:** 45th percentile assist rate – can run second unit
- **Efficiency problem:** 19th percentile true shooting (49.6%) is major concern
- **Limited size:** 5'6" creates challenges finishing at rim

**Defensive Liability:**
- **Size mismatch:** Smallest player in rotation, creates defensive exploits
- **Poor rebounding:** 4th percentile rebounding rate
- **Steal deficiency:** 11th percentile steal rate despite guard position

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs talent around her:** -12.3 net impact means she must play with elite talent
- **Cannot anchor lineup:** Bench unit struggles with her as primary option
- **Benefits from NaLyssa Smith:** Smith's +8.0 net helps mask Evans's negative impact

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Strict minutes management:** 15-18 MPG maximum to limit negative impact
2. **NEVER pair with Aaliyah Nye:** Both have negative impact (-12.3 + -10.7 = disaster)
3. **NEVER pair with Chelsea Gray:** Turnover issues compound despite Evans's solid TOV%
4. **Use in specific matchups:** Against smaller backup guards only
5. **Shooting development:** 19th percentile TS% must improve to expand role

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Four significant weaknesses:** TS%, TREB%, STL%, FT% all below 25th percentile
- **Net impact concern:** -12.3 differential is massive liability
- **Role limitations:** Cannot be relied upon in important moments

**Position:** G-F | **Height:** 6'1" | **Experience:** 4 years (Young)  
**Games:** 47 | **MPG:** 11.8 | **2022 Draft:** #11 overall (R1)

- **When ON:** ORtg 99.4 | DRtg 96.8 | NetRtg +2.6
- **When OFF:** ORtg 109.5 | DRtg 105.3 | NetRtg +4.2
- **Differential:** **-1.6 net rating** (7th on team)
- **Defensive paradox:** DRtg improves +8.5 when she's on court despite poor overall rating

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Spacing specialist:** 93rd percentile 3PT attempt rate (48.7%) provides elite floor spacing
- **Conversion problem:** 3rd percentile true shooting (45.5%) – shoots but doesn't make
- **Ball security:** 91st percentile turnover rate – doesn't make mistakes, just misses shots
- **Developmental player:** 4th year at age 25 – should be entering prime

**Defensive Contribution:**
- **Perimeter defender:** 6'1" size allows switching 2-4 positions
- **Impact despite rating:** Team DRtg improves +8.5 with her on court
- **Hustle player:** Defensive effort impacts game beyond statistics

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs creators:** Cannot create own shot, requires setup from Chelsea/Jackie
- **Benefits from NaLyssa pairing:** Smith's paint presence + Bell's spacing = floor balance
- **Defensive role:** Can guard opponent's best wing in limited minutes

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Shot development priority:** 3rd percentile TS% is fixable with mechanics work
2. **Confidence building:** Elite spacing value (93rd percentile 3PT rate) should be maintained
3. **Selective usage:** 10-15 MPG in games where spacing is critical
4. **NEVER with Aaliyah Nye:** Both 90th+ 3PT rate but poor conversion = "spacing illusion"
5. **Perimeter defense role:** Use her defensive switchability in playoffs

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Six weaknesses:** Most improvement areas on team (PER, TS%, AST%, TREB%, DRtg, WS)
- **Shot conversion crisis:** Right shot profile, wrong execution
- **Development question:** Year 4 with minimal improvement – is this her ceiling?

## 8. AALIYAH NYE - 3PT Specialist

**Position:** G-F | **Height:** 6'0" | **Experience:** 1 year (Rookie)  
**Games:** 50 | **MPG:** 13.8 | **2025 Draft:** #13 overall (R2)

### Statistical Profile
| Metric | Value | Positional Percentile | League Percentile | Flag |
|--------|-------|----------------------|-------------------|------|
| **3PT Attempt Rate** | 65.9% | **98th** | 93rd | ELITE |

- **When OFF:** ORtg 109.9 | DRtg 102.0 | NetRtg +7.9
- **Differential:** **-10.7 net rating** (2nd-worst on team)

### Individual Tendencies in Team Context

**Offensive Role:**
- **Pure shooting specialist:** 98th percentile 3PT attempt rate (65.9%) – most specialized player
- **Conversion struggles:** 10th percentile true shooting (47.0%) – rookie struggles
- **No playmaking:** 7th percentile assist rate – not a creator
- **One-dimensional:** Entire value proposition is 3PT shooting

**Defensive Liability:**
- **Negative impact:** Team DRtg worsens 3.4 points with her on court
- **Rookie learning curve:** Expected for first-year player
- **Physical tools:** 6'0" size should allow development

**Team Dependencies:**
- **Needs elite talent around her:** -10.7 net means cannot play with other negatives
- **Benefits from Chelsea's playmaking:** Drive-and-kick opportunities
- **Garbage time role:** Limited to non-critical situations currently

**Coaching Recommendations:**
1. **Development focus:** Year 1 rookie – be patient with struggles
2. **Shot selection refinement:** 98th percentile rate is too high for 10th percentile efficiency
3. **Situational minutes only:** 8-12 MPG in specific matchups requiring spacing
4. **NEVER with Dana Evans:** Both negative impact players
5. **NEVER with Kierstan Bell:** Both elite 3PT rate but poor conversion

**Weaknesses to Monitor:**
- **Five weaknesses:** PER, TS%, AST%, STL%, WS all below 13th percentile
- **Worst net impact among non-injured:** -10.7 is significant liability
- **Development required:** Needs full offseason to improve efficiency
