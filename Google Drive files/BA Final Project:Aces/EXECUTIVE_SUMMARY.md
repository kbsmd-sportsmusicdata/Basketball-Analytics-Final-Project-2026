## Analytics-Driven Coaching Strategy - Executive Summary

**Prepared for:** Basketball Analytics Course Final Project  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Focus:** Top 8 Rotation Optimization & Strategic Recommendations

---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Championship Foundation: Elite Core Trio

The Aces possess a **generational three-player core** that provides +64.9 combined net rating impact:

- **A'ja Wilson** (+29.3 net rating): Only player in analysis with **7 elite skills** (90th+ percentile) and **zero weaknesses**. Dominates in PER (100th), assists for a center (100th among Cs), steals (95th), defensive rating (94th), and win shares (100th). The engine of both offense (+19.6 ORtg impact) and defense (+9.8 DRtg impact).

- **Jackie Young** (+22.5 net rating): **Elite two-way star** with 100th percentile PER among guards, 94th percentile true shooting, and elite free throw shooting (91st). Provides secondary scoring (16.5 PPG) with exceptional efficiency (60.3 TS%) while defending at an elite level.

- **Chelsea Gray** (+13.2 net rating): The team's **floor general** with 89th percentile assist rate but significant turnover concerns (16th percentile TOV%). Her elite playmaking (+19.6 ORtg impact) is essential for setting up the offense, though defensive slippage (-6.5 DRtg impact) requires lineup management.

**Strategic Implication:** This core must play together in critical moments. Their combined impact (+14.3 per 100 possessions when averaged) represents championship-caliber production.

### 2. The Championship Transformation: Phase 1 vs Phase 2

The 2025 season tells a story of mid-season awakening:

| Phase | Record | Net Rating | eFG% | TOV% | Key Insight |
|-------|--------|------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Phase 1 (Games 1-28)** | 14-14 | -3.1 | 47.8% | 15.7% | Struggling, below league average |
| **Phase 2 (Games 29-44)** | 16-0 | **+17.0** | **55.5%** | **13.7%** | Elite on both ends |
| **Phase 3 (Playoffs)** | 9-3 | +8.1 | 52.1% | 14.2% | Championship execution |

**The Transformation:** A **+20.1 point net rating swing** driven by:
- **Shooting breakthrough**: +7.7 percentage points eFG% improvement with the **same shot selection**
- **Ball security**: Turnover rate improved from 15.7% to 13.7% (both elite markers)
- **Two-way excellence**: Simultaneous offensive AND defensive improvement

**Critical Finding:** The team didn't change *what* shots they took – they improved *making* the shots they were already taking. This suggests confidence, rhythm, and health factors were key, not tactical adjustments.

### 3. The Anti-Analytics Champions

The Aces succeed by **violating modern basketball orthodoxy**:

- **Shot Selection Rank:** #13 in WNBA in Rim+3PT frequency (53% "good" shots)
- **Efficiency Rank:** #4 in WNBA in True Shooting % (55.2%)

**Translation:** They take the 13th-most "analytics-friendly" shots but achieve the 4th-best efficiency. They win by making "bad" (midrange) shots at elite rates, particularly through A'ja Wilson's 71.5% midrange shot frequency.

**Strategic Advantage:** This profile creates a **mismatch problem** for opponents who scheme for modern offenses. The Aces can:
1. Exploit defensive attention on the 3-point line through elite midrange efficiency
2. Leverage A'ja's dominant post game when defenses collapse
3. Attack second-chance opportunities (rebounding strength)

---

### 4. Roster Depth: The 8-Player Rotation Strategy

**Top 5 (Combined +71.4 Net Rating):**
1. A'ja Wilson (+29.3) - Generational Talent
2. Jackie Young (+22.5) - Elite Two-Way Star  
3. Chelsea Gray (+13.2) - Primary Ball Handler
4. NaLyssa Smith (+8.0) - Paint Presence
5. Jewell Loyd (+2.4) - Ball Security Specialist

**Depth Options (Role Players):**
6. Dana Evans (-12.3) - Playmaking depth, efficiency concerns
7. Kierstan Bell (-1.6) - Stretch forward with elite 3PT rate (93rd percentile) but poor conversion
8. Aaliyah Nye (-10.7) - 3PT specialist (98th percentile rate) still developing

**Rotation Philosophy:**
- **Maximize top 5 minutes**: Wilson (32.3 mpg), Young (31.4 mpg), Gray (32.1 mpg) play heavy minutes
- **Strategic deployment of #6-8**: Use Bell for spacing, Loyd for ball security, limit Evans/Nye pairing (both negative impact)
- **Avoid conflict combinations**: Never pair Dana Evans + Aaliyah Nye (efficiency collapse), or Chelsea Gray + Dana Evans (turnover cascade)

---

### 5. Strategic Lineup Recommendations

**Championship Closing Lineup (Games within 5 points, last 5 minutes):**
- A'ja Wilson, Jackie Young, Chelsea Gray, Kierstan Bell, NaLyssa Smith
- Expected: +14.3 net rating
- Rationale: Maximize star talent (+64.9 from core 3), add twin towers (Wilson+Smith) paint dominance, and Bell's spacing (93rd percentile 3PT rate)

**Alternative Situational Lineups:**

| Situation | Lineup | Key Advantage |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Need offense** | Wilson, Young, Gray, Loyd, Smith | +15.1 net rating expected, Loyd's shot creation |
| **Protect lead** | Wilson, Young, Bell, Smith, Loyd | Elite defense - A'ja (94th DRtg) + Jackie + twin towers |
| **Push pace** | Wilson, Young, Gray, Bell, Loyd | Small ball with A'ja at 5, four perimeter threats |
| **Rest starters** | Smith, Loyd, Bell, Evans, Nye | Smith anchors (-2.8 net), minimize damage |

---

### 6. Complementary Skill Matrix (Top Pairings)

**ELITE Compatibility:**
- **A'ja + Jackie** (+51.8 combined net): Elite two-way foundation, both 90th+ offense & defense
- **A'ja + Chelsea** (+42.5 combined net): Playmaking sets up dominance, Gray's 89th percentile AST% maximizes Wilson

**HIGH Compatibility:**
- **Jackie + Chelsea**: Dual ball-handlers, Jackie's elite TOV% covers Chelsea's weakness (16th percentile)
- **A'ja + NaLyssa**: Twin towers, paint dominance, rebounding superiority
- **Chelsea + Jewell**: Ball security duo (both elite TOV%), complementary playmaking

**AVOID:**
- Dana Evans + Aaliyah Nye: Both -10+ net impact, efficiency issues compound
- Kierstan Bell + Aaliyah Nye: "Spacing illusion" - both shoot 3s at elite rates but convert poorly
- Chelsea Gray + Dana Evans: Turnover cascade risk

---

### 7. Opponent-Specific Adjustments

**Against Elite Guard Play (Phoenix, Seattle):**
- Emphasize Jackie Young's perimeter defense (elite two-way rating)
- Use Jewell Loyd's ball security (93rd percentile TOV%) to limit turnovers
- Exploit size advantage with twin towers (Wilson + Smith)

**Against Size/Rebounding Teams (Minnesota, New York):**
- Play NaLyssa Smith + A'ja Wilson together more (paint dominance)
- Limit small ball lineups
- Crash offensive glass (Wilson 93rd percentile OREB%)

**Against Three-Point Heavy Teams:**
- Chelsea Gray + Jackie Young defensive backcourt
- Kierstan Bell for perimeter defense (despite offensive struggles)
- Contest and force midrange (where Aces excel)

## CRITICAL PRIORITIES FOR COACHING STAFF

### Priority 1: Maximize Core 3 Minutes Together
**Target:** 28-30 minutes per game for Wilson-Young-Gray trio

The +64.9 combined net impact represents a **20+ point advantage per 48 minutes** when all three play. Stagger rest sparingly and only when ahead by 10+.

### Priority 2: Solve Chelsea Gray's Turnover Problem
**Current:** 16th percentile TOV% (weakness)  
**Target:** 50th percentile or better

Gray's elite playmaking (89th percentile AST%) is undermined by turnovers. Focus areas:
- Decision-making in transition (slow down)
- Pick-and-roll reads (earlier passes)
- Limit high-risk cross-court passes

### Priority 3: Develop Kierstan Bell's Shot Conversion
**Current:** 93rd percentile 3PT attempt rate, 3rd percentile TS%  
**Issue:** Right shot profile, poor execution

Bell provides elite spacing threat but doesn't convert. Development focus:
- Shooting mechanics refinement
- Shot selection within 3PT attempts (corner vs above break)
- Confidence-building in practice reps

### Priority 4: Manage Aaliyah Nye's Development
**Current:** 98th percentile 3PT rate, 10th percentile TS%, -10.7 net impact  
**Approach:** Limited situational minutes

Nye is a pure specialist still developing. Use only:
- Garbage time for experience
- Specific matchups requiring shooting spacing
- Never with Dana Evans (both negative impact)

### Priority 5: Maintain Phase 2 Shooting Excellence
**Key Risk:** Regression to Phase 1 shooting (47.8% eFG%)  
**Safeguard:** Monitor individual TS% weekly, rhythm maintenance

The championship window depends on sustaining 55%+ eFG%. Weekly tracking of:
- Individual shot charts (hot/cold zones)
- Assisted vs unassisted rates
- Shot quality metrics (expected vs actual FG%)

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

**With Recommended Strategy:**
- Regular season record: 38-12 or better (76% win rate)
- Playoff positioning: Top 3 seed
- Championship probability: High (elite net rating differential)

**Key Indicators to Monitor:**
1. Core 3 net rating when together (should maintain +15 or better)
2. Team eFG% (maintain 52%+ to stay elite)
3. Chelsea Gray TOV% improvement trajectory
4. Bench unit net rating (limit to -5 or better)

---

## CONCLUSION

The Las Vegas Aces possess a **championship-caliber foundation** led by generational talent (A'ja Wilson), an elite two-way star (Jackie Young), and a floor general (Chelsea Gray). Their Phase 2 transformation (+20.1 net rating swing) demonstrates the ceiling when healthy and confident.

**The path to a championship requires:**
1. Maximizing the core 3's minutes together
2. Strategic lineup deployment based on complementary skills
3. Avoiding negative-impact pairings (Evans+Nye, Bell+Nye, Gray+Evans)
4. Maintaining Phase 2-level shooting efficiency
5. Tactical adjustments against specific opponent strengths

The anti-analytics shot profile is a **strategic advantage**, not a weakness. Opponents expecting modern shot distribution will be exploited by elite midrange efficiency. The combination of A'ja's dominance, elite ball security (multiple 90th+ percentile TOV% players), and championship experience positions this team for sustained success.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with confidence in this roster construction and rotation strategy.
