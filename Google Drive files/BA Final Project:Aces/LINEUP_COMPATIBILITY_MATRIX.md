# Las Vegas Aces 2025 Season
## Lineup Compatibility Matrix & Strategic Recommendations

**Purpose:** Identify complementary player pairings and problematic combinations based on weighted positional percentiles and on/off court impact  
**Analysis Basis:** Net rating differentials, skill complementarity, and statistical tendencies across 8-player rotation

---

## COMPLEMENTARY PAIR RATINGS

### ELITE COMPATIBILITY (Combined Net +40.0 or Higher)

**1. A'ja Wilson + Jackie Young**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +51.8 (+29.3 + 22.5)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Both elite on offense AND defense (90th+ percentiles in both)
  - Wilson's 100th percentile AST% (for C) + Young's 85th percentile AST% = dual playmaking
  - Young's 94th percentile TS% complements Wilson's 89th percentile TS% = elite efficiency duo
  - Zero statistical weaknesses between them
- **Strategic Value:** Championship foundation - must play together in all critical moments
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 28-30 MPG minimum

**2. A'ja Wilson + Chelsea Gray**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +42.5 (+29.3 + 13.2)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Gray's 89th percentile AST% sets up Wilson's elite scoring (31.4% usage, 58.3% TS%)
  - Wilson's post presence creates kick-out assists for Gray
  - Pick-and-roll chemistry: Gray's playmaking + Wilson's finishing
  - Offensive synergy overcomes Gray's defensive slippage (-6.5 DRtg when on)
- **Strategic Value:** Primary offensive engine - maximizes Wilson's touches
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 26-28 MPG
- **Caution:** Need defensive support around this pairing (Gray's 16th percentile TOV%)

---

### HIGH COMPATIBILITY (Combined Net +20.0 to +39.9)

**3. Jackie Young + Chelsea Gray**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +35.7 (+22.5 + 13.2)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Dual ball-handlers both 85th+ percentile AST%
  - Young's elite ball security (implied from zero weaknesses) covers Gray's 16th percentile TOV%
  - Both efficient scorers (Young 94th TS%, Gray 82nd TS%)
  - Can alternate primary playmaking responsibilities
- **Strategic Value:** Backcourt foundation - offense flows through both
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 26-28 MPG
- **Lineup Impact:** When together, reduce Gray's risky passes - Young provides safety valve

**4. A'ja Wilson + NaLyssa Smith**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +37.3 (+29.3 + 8.0)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Twin towers: Wilson 93rd percentile TREB%, Smith 75th percentile BLK%
  - Paint dominance: Both score efficiently inside (Wilson 58.3% TS%, Smith 58.8% TS%)
  - High-low game potential (Wilson 100th percentile AST% for C)
  - Defensive rim protection: Elite shot-blocking duo
- **Strategic Value:** Size advantage against bigger opponents (Minnesota, New York)
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 18-22 MPG (situational)
- **Best Against:** Teams with traditional bigs, slower pace

**5. Chelsea Gray + Jewell Loyd**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +15.6 (+13.2 + 2.4)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Ball security duo: Gray 89th AST% + Loyd 93rd percentile TOV% = elite security
  - Loyd's elite turnover rate (8.8%) mitigates Gray's weakness (17.9%, 16th percentile)
  - Complementary usage: Gray facilitates (30.7% AST%), Loyd finishes (11.2 PPG)
  - Perimeter spacing: Loyd 77th percentile 3PT attempt rate
- **Strategic Value:** Gray's best pairing to minimize turnover risk
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 20-24 MPG
- **Lineup Impact:** Loyd acts as safety valve for Gray's aggressive passes

---

### MODERATE COMPATIBILITY (Combined Net +5.0 to +19.9)

**6. Jackie Young + Kierstan Bell**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +20.9 (+22.5 + (-1.6))
- **Why it Works:**
  - Young's creation (85th percentile AST%) sets up Bell's spacing (93rd percentile 3PT rate)
  - Bell's 91st percentile TOV% means she won't turn it over even if shots don't fall
  - Defensive versatility: Both can switch 1-4 positions
  - Young's elite efficiency (94th TS%) compensates for Bell's struggles (3rd percentile TS%)
- **Strategic Value:** Spacing + creation when Bell is shooting well
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 12-16 MPG (when Bell's shot is falling)
- **Caution:** Monitor Bell's shooting - if cold, sub her out

**7. A'ja Wilson + Kierstan Bell**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +27.7 (+29.3 + (-1.6))
- **Why it Works:**
  - Interior dominance + perimeter spacing: Wilson inside, Bell 93rd percentile 3PT rate
  - Bell's elite spacing (48.7% 3PT attempt rate) opens driving lanes for Wilson
  - Wilson's gravity creates open catch-and-shoot for Bell
  - Defensive balance: Wilson rim protection + Bell perimeter switching
- **Strategic Value:** Floor spacing for Wilson's post game
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 10-14 MPG (situational)
- **Best Use:** When opponents pack the paint against Wilson

**8. NaLyssa Smith + Kierstan Bell**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +6.4 (+8.0 + (-1.6))
- **Why it Works:**
  - Paint + stretch forward: Smith interior (58.8% TS%) + Bell perimeter (93rd 3PT rate)
  - Floor balance: Smith's paint presence + Bell's spacing
  - Smith's +8.0 net rating stabilizes Bell's -1.6 negative impact
  - Rebounding: Smith 61st percentile TREB% covers Bell's 16th percentile weakness
- **Strategic Value:** Bench unit floor balance
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 8-12 MPG (second unit)
- **Best Use:** When starters rest, need spacing + paint presence

**9. Jackie Young + Jewell Loyd**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +24.9 (+22.5 + 2.4)
- **Why it Works:**
  - Elite ball security: Young (implied elite from zero weaknesses) + Loyd 93rd percentile TOV%
  - Dual scoring threats: Young 16.5 PPG + Loyd 11.2 PPG
  - Defensive switchability: Both can guard multiple positions
  - Complementary playmaking: Young 85th AST% + Loyd provides spacing
- **Strategic Value:** Backcourt depth when Gray rests
- **Recommended Minutes Together:** 8-12 MPG
- **Best Use:** When Chelsea sits, this duo runs the offense

---

## LINEUP CONFLICTS TO AVOID

### CRITICAL - NEVER PLAY TOGETHER

**1. Dana Evans + Aaliyah Nye**
- **Combined Net Rating:** -23.0 (-12.3 + -10.7)
- **Why it Fails:**
  - Both negative impact players: Team loses 23 points per 100 possessions combined
  - Efficiency compounds: Evans 19th TS%, Nye 10th TS% = shooting disaster
  - No creation: Evans 45th AST%, Nye 7th AST% = stagnant offense
  - Defensive liabilities: Both below-average defenders (size + rookie struggles)
- **Impact:** Opponents would go on immediate run
- **Coaching Rule:** NEVER on court simultaneously under any circumstance

**2. Kierstan Bell + Aaliyah Nye**
- **Combined Net Rating:** -12.3 (-1.6 + -10.7)
- **Why it Fails:**
  - "Spacing Illusion": Both 90th+ percentile 3PT attempt rate BUT:
    - Bell: 3rd percentile TS% (45.5%)
    - Nye: 10th percentile TS% (47.0%)
  - High volume, low conversion = wasted possessions
  - No playmaking: Bell 9th AST%, Nye 7th AST% = can't create for each other
  - Both need setup from others but can't set up teammates
- **Impact:** Looks like spacing but delivers empty possessions
- **Coaching Rule:** Never together even in garbage time (reinforces bad habits)

**3. Chelsea Gray + Dana Evans**
- **Combined Net Rating:** +0.9 (+13.2 + -12.3)
- **Why it Fails:**
  - "Turnover Cascade": Gray's 16th percentile TOV% + Evans's instability = chaos
  - Despite Evans 82nd TOV%, combining two ball-handlers with mixed security = risk
  - Both need the ball: Gray 30.7% AST% + Evans 16.7% AST% = redundant roles
  - Defensive disaster: Gray -6.5 DRtg impact + Evans size mismatch = exploitable backcourt
- **Impact:** High-risk offense, vulnerable defense
- **Coaching Rule:** Never together in close games, limit even in blowouts

---

### PROBLEMATIC - MINIMIZE MINUTES TOGETHER

**4. Jewell Loyd + Dana Evans**
- **Combined Net Rating:** -9.9 (+2.4 + -12.3)
- **Why it Struggles:**
  - Ball movement problems: Loyd 18th AST%, Evans 45th AST% = stagnant offense
  - Both need creation from others but can't create for teammates
  - Limited playmaking: Can't run offense without Chelsea or Jackie
  - Efficiency concerns: Loyd 49th TS%, Evans 19th TS% = below-average scoring
- **Impact:** Offense stalls without primary playmaker
- **Coaching Rule:** Maximum 4-6 minutes together, only with elite talent around them

**5. NaLyssa Smith + Dana Evans**
- **Combined Net Rating:** -4.3 (+8.0 + -12.3)
- **Why it Struggles:**
  - Creation mismatch: Smith 4th AST% + Evans 45th AST% = neither can set up Smith
  - Smith needs playmaker to score (catch-and-finish only)
  - Evans can't facilitate enough to maximize Smith's paint presence
  - Smith's +8.0 net partially masks Evans's -12.3, but pairing is suboptimal
- **Impact:** Inefficient offense, Smith underutilized
- **Coaching Rule:** Only together when Gray/Jackie rest simultaneously (8-10 MPG max)

---

  - Requires Bell to hit open shots to maintain spacing
- **Coaching Keys:**
  1. Run offense through Wilson-Gray pick-and-roll
  2. Young as pressure release valve when Gray is trapped
  3. Bell must stay ready for catch-and-shoot (don't force)
  4. Smith works offensive glass for second chances
  5. Switch everything on defense, Young takes opponent's best perimeter

---

### 2. OFFENSIVE FIREPOWER LINEUP
**Wilson, Young, Gray, Loyd, Smith**

- **Expected Net Rating:** +15.1 average (highest)
- **When to Use:** Need scoring burst, falling behind by 8+, opponent goes on run
- **Strengths:**
  - Maximum offensive talent: Replace Bell's poor shooting with Loyd's creation

  - Slightly worse defense: Loyd neutral defender vs Bell's switchability
  - Higher usage compression: More mouths to feed
- **Coaching Keys:**
  1. Stagger possessions: Wilson-Gray PnR alternates with Young-Loyd two-man game
  2. Loyd works as cutter off Wilson's post-ups
  3. Gray feeds Wilson early, then shifts to Young/Loyd
  4. Smith crashes offensive glass while others space floor
  5. Trust offense to outscore opponent (trade baskets)

---

### 3. DEFENSIVE LOCKDOWN LINEUP
**Wilson, Young, Bell, Smith, Loyd**

- **Expected Net Rating:** +12.1 average
- **When to Use:** Protect lead (up 10-15), stop opponent's run, playoff defensive stands
- **Strengths:**
  - Elite rim protection: Wilson 94th DRtg + Smith 75th BLK%
  - Perimeter switching: Young-Bell-Loyd all 5'10"-6'1", can switch 1-4
  - Defensive versatility: Five players who can guard multiple positions
  - Ball security: Young + Loyd 93rd TOV% = low giveaway risk
  - Rebounding: Wilson 93rd TREB% + Smith 61st TREB% = control glass
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Reduced playmaking: No Chelsea Gray (89th AST%) to run offense
  - Bell's 3rd TS% and Loyd's 49th TS% limit scoring punch
  - Requires Young to run point (capable but not ideal full-time)
  - Less offensive firepower without Gray's creation
- **Coaching Keys:**
  1. Young becomes primary ball-handler (85th percentile AST% capable)
  2. Wilson controls paint, Smith helps at rim
  3. Bell-Loyd switch on perimeter, Young takes toughest assignment
  4. Limit possessions: Slow pace, milk clock, force tough shots
  5. Transition defense priority: Sprint back, no easy baskets

---

### 4. SMALL BALL BLITZ LINEUP
**Wilson, Young, Gray, Bell, Loyd**

- **Expected Net Rating:** +13.2 average
- **When to Use:** Opponent plays big/slow, need to push pace, force tempo change
- **Strengths:**
  - Speed advantage: A'ja at 5 creates mismatches (too quick for traditional bigs)
  - Four perimeter threats: Young-Gray-Bell-Loyd all can shoot/handle
  - Elite playmaking: Gray 89th AST% + Young 85th AST% + Wilson 100th AST% (for C)
  - Pace control: Can push tempo relentlessly, tire opponent's bigs
  - Switching: All five can switch 1-5 in small-ball scheme
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Rebounding: No Smith (61st TREB%), lose second-chance points

  - Bell's shooting: 3rd percentile TS% remains major concern
  - Size disadvantage: If opponent matches small, lose advantage
- **Coaching Keys:**
  1. PUSH PACE: Get out in transition immediately after rebound/make
  2. Wilson operates at elbow/high post, not traditional 5 position
  3. Gray runs pick-and-roll with Wilson at 5 = unstoppable combo
  4. Bell-Loyd space corners for kick-outs
  5. Young orchestrates fast break, Gray in half-court

---

### 5. BENCH UNIT LINEUP
**Smith, Loyd, Bell, Evans, Nye**

- **Expected Net Rating:** -2.8 average (acceptable for bench unit)
- **When to Use:** Rest starters (6-8 minute stretches), build bench chemistry, mop-up duty
- **Strengths:**
  - Smith anchors: +8.0 net provides stability
  - Loyd's ball security: 93rd TOV% prevents giveaways
  - Spacing: Bell 93rd 3PT rate + Nye 98th 3PT rate = floor spread
  - Avoids worst pairings: No Evans-Nye together, no Gray-Evans
  - Development time: Gives young players (Bell, Nye) reps
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Negative impact players: Evans -12.3, Nye -10.7, Bell -1.6
  - Shooting efficiency disaster: Evans 19th TS%, Nye 10th TS%, Bell 3rd TS%
  - Limited creation: Evans 45th AST%, Nye 7th AST%, Bell 9th AST%
  - Must play limited minutes (6-8 max before starter returns)
- **Coaching Keys:**
  1. Smith facilitates from post (she can pass)
  2. Loyd primary ball-handler (not Evans) to limit turnovers
  3. Bell and Nye spot-up only (no creation)
  4. Evans runs second unit but limited usage
  5. CRITICAL: Sub starters back by 3:00 mark in quarter (before deficit grows)
  6. If lead shrinks by 8+, sub starters back immediately

**Protecting Lead (Up 12-20 points):**
- Primary: Defensive Lockdown (Wilson, Young, Bell, Smith, Loyd)
- Strategy: Slow pace, limit possessions, force tough shots
- Clock management: Milk possessions to 18+ seconds

---

### OPPONENT-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

**vs. Size-Heavy Teams (Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty):**
- Starting Lineup: Twin Towers (Wilson + Smith start together)
- Key Adjustment: Wilson at 4, Smith at 5 for paint dominance
- Substitution: Bell gets fewer minutes, Smith plays 26-28 MPG

**vs. Small Ball Teams (Connecticut Sun, Phoenix Mercury):**
- Starting Lineup: Small Ball Blitz (Wilson at 5)
- Key Adjustment: Push pace relentlessly, exploit speed
- Substitution: Smith plays 18-20 MPG, more perimeter minutes for Bell/Loyd

**vs. Elite Perimeter Offense (Seattle Storm, Dallas Wings):**
- Starting Lineup: Defensive Lockdown elements
- Key Adjustment: Young on opponent's best guard, Bell/Loyd switch others
- Defensive Priority: No open threes, force twos

**vs. Weak Interior Defense:**
- Starting Lineup: Twin Towers (Wilson + Smith)

- Goal: Score 60+ points in paint, dominate boards

---

## CRITICAL LINEUP RULES - MEMORIZE

✓ **ALWAYS TOGETHER:**
- A'ja + Jackie in close games (combined +51.8 net)
- A'ja + Chelsea for offensive sets (+42.5 net)
- Chelsea + Jackie for backcourt foundation (+35.7 net)

✓ **PREFER TOGETHER:**
- Chelsea + Jewell (Loyd's 93rd TOV% covers Gray's 16th weakness)
- Jackie + Kierstan (when Bell is shooting well)
- A'ja + NaLyssa (vs. size-heavy opponents)

✗ **NEVER TOGETHER:**
- Dana + Aaliyah (combined -23.0 net = disaster)
- Kierstan + Aaliyah ("spacing illusion" - high 3PT rate, poor conversion)
- Chelsea + Dana (turnover cascade risk)

✗ **MINIMIZE TOGETHER:**
- Jewell + Dana (ball movement problems, <6 minutes max)
- NaLyssa + Dana (creation mismatch, only when Gray/Jackie both rest)

---

- **9:00-6:00:** Elite trio MUST be together
- **6:00-0:00:** Championship Closing lineup (no exceptions if game close)
  - If leading by 20+: Bench unit can finish
  - If within 15: Starters stay entire 6 minutes

---

## TIMEOUT SUBSTITUTION STRATEGY

**After Opponent Timeout (Dead Ball Opportunity):**
1. Assess current lineup net rating
2. If negative pairing on court (Evans + Nye), immediately sub
3. If elite duo not together (A'ja + Jackie), prioritize reunion
4. If opponent making run, insert Offensive Firepower lineup

**After Team Timeout (Strategic Adjustment):**
1. Review last 3 possessions (offensive/defensive effectiveness)
2. Match opponent's adjustments (size vs. speed)
3. Insert rested elite players (60-90 second rest = fresh legs)
4. Communicate specific matchup assignments before inbound

---

## INJURY/FOUL TROUBLE CONTINGENCIES

### If A'ja Wilson Out (Foul Trouble or Injury)
- **Immediate Adjustment:** NaLyssa Smith to starting 5, plays 28-30 MPG
- **Lineup:** Young, Gray, Bell, Smith + 5th (Loyd or Evans)
- **Offensive Strategy:** Gray-Young pick-and-roll becomes primary action
- **Defensive Strategy:** Smith anchors paint, team defense must overcompensate
- **Expected Net Rating Drop:** -18 to -22 points (team cannot replace A'ja)

### If Jackie Young Out (Foul Trouble or Injury)
- **Immediate Adjustment:** Jewell Loyd to starting 5
- **Lineup:** Wilson, Gray, Bell, Smith, Loyd
- **Offensive Strategy:** Gray usage increases, Loyd spot-up role
- **Defensive Strategy:** Bell takes toughest perimeter assignment
- **Expected Net Rating Drop:** -12 to -15 points

### If Chelsea Gray Out (Foul Trouble or Injury)
- **Immediate Adjustment:** Jackie Young becomes primary ball-handler
- **Lineup:** Wilson, Young, Bell, Smith, Loyd
- **Offensive Strategy:** Young runs point (85th percentile AST% capable)
- **Defensive Strategy:** Improved perimeter defense without Gray
- **Expected Net Rating Drop:** -8 to -10 points (Young can mitigate)

### If Multiple Elite Out (Disaster Scenario)
- **Two of Core 3 Out:** Concede game as likely loss
- **Emergency Lineup:** Best available + Smith + Loyd
- **Strategy:** Survive minutes, hope for garbage time
- **Do NOT:** Panic and play Evans + Nye together

---

## ADVANCED METRIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Net Rating Thresholds for Lineup Changes
- **+15.0 or better:** Maintain current lineup (elite performance)
- **+8.0 to +14.9:** Continue but monitor (solid performance)
- **0.0 to +7.9:** Consider adjustment if sustained (mediocre)
- **-7.9 to 0.0:** Adjust within 2 minutes (below standard)
- **-8.0 or worse:** Immediate substitution (unacceptable)

### Minutes Distribution Targets (Per Game)
- **96+ Star Rating (A'ja):** 32-34 MPG
- **85+ Star Rating (Jackie):** 30-32 MPG
- **62+ Star Rating (Chelsea):** 30-32 MPG
- **57 Star Rating (NaLyssa):** 22-24 MPG
- **29 Star Rating (Kierstan):** 10-15 MPG
- **Below 0 Net (Dana/Aaliyah):** <18 MPG combined

### Turnover Management Protocols
- **Chelsea Gray at 4+ TO:** Reduce ball-handling, more off-ball
- **Chelsea Gray at 6+ TO:** Sub out for Jewell Loyd (ball security)
- **Team at 15+ TO:** Slow pace, simplify offense, limit Gray's risk-taking
- **Opponent at 20+ TO:** Press full-court, force more mistakes
