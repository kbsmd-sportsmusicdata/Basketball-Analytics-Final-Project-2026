## How to Integrate into Player Profiles

### New Columns to Add to `aces_player_profiles_final_2025.csv`:

```python
# Add these columns from the percentile analysis:
positional_percentile_cols = [
    # Core efficiency
    'PER_pctile_pos', 'ts_pct_pctile_pos', 'EFG%_pctile_pos',
    
    # Playmaking
    'AST%_pctile_pos', 'TOV%_pctile_pos',
    
    # Rebounding & Defense
    'TREB%_pctile_pos', 'STL%_pctile_pos', 'BLK%_pctile_pos',
    'player_def_rtg_pctile_pos',
    
    # Overall value
    'win_shares_pctile_pos', 'player_off_rtg_pctile_pos',
    
    # Shooting profile
    '3p_rate_pctile_pos', 'FT%_pctile_pos'
]

# Add these rankings (recalculated for 10+ MPG)
new_rankings = [
    'PER_rank_filtered', 'ts_pct_rank_filtered', 'win_shares_rank_filtered',
    'player_off_rtg_rank_filtered', 'player_def_rtg_rank_filtered'

## Files Generated

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `aces_top8_positional_percentiles_2025.csv` | Aces players with all percentiles (86 columns) |
| `wnba_2025_all_players_with_percentiles.csv` | Full league data with percentiles |
| `wnba_2025_filtered_with_percentiles.csv` | 10+ MPG filter, all calculations |

## Technical Notes

### Percentile Calculation Method
- Used pandas `rank(pct=True)` for continuous ranking
- For "lower is better" stats (TOV%, DRtg, PF%), inverted percentile (1 - rank)
- Positional percentiles calculated within exact position groups (G, F, C, G-F, C-F)

### Ranking Recalculation
Original dataset had rankings based on all 184 players. New rankings (`*_rank_filtered`) are based only on 150 players with 10+ MPG, providing more meaningful context for rotation players.
