| **2Q** | 12:00-8:00 | Bench + 1 elite (Young or Gray) |
| **2Q** | 8:00-3:00 | Build back to starters |
| **2Q** | 3:00-0:00 | Championship Closing to end half |
| **3Q** | 12:00-6:00 | Starters (full energy) |
| **3Q** | 6:00-0:00 | Strategic subs based on score |

## 📈 MINUTES DISTRIBUTION TARGETS
