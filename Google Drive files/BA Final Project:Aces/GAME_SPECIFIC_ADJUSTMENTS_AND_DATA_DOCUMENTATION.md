# Game-Specific Adjustments

## Overview

This section provides strategic recommendations for how the Las Vegas Aces should adjust their approach based on opponent styles, team vulnerabilities, and individual matchups. These adjustments leverage the positional percentile analysis, lineup compatibility matrix, and player archetype classifications developed throughout this analysis.

---

## Opponent Style Classification

WNBA teams can be categorized into distinct playing styles that require different strategic responses:

### Style 1: Size-Heavy Interior Teams
**Examples:** Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty

**Characteristics:**
- Elite post players anchoring the offense
- Strong rebounding advantage on both ends
- Half-court oriented pace (below league average)
- High paint touch frequency

**Aces Vulnerabilities:**
- When NaLyssa Smith (6th percentile FT%) is fouled intentionally
- Limited rim protection depth if Wilson in foul trouble
- Chelsea Gray's turnover tendency (16th percentile TOV%) against length

**Recommended Adjustments:**
1. **Deploy Twin Towers Configuration** — Start Wilson and Smith together for paint dominance (both players together for 20-22 MPG vs. typical 18-20)
2. **Feed Wilson Early** — Her 100th percentile PER among centers establishes interior dominance
3. **Control the Boards** — Wilson (93rd percentile TREB%) and Smith (61st percentile TREB%) must win the rebounding battle
4. **Limit Transition Opportunities** — Size-heavy teams thrive in half-court; don't give them easy baskets

---

### Style 2: Elite Perimeter Offense Teams
**Examples:** Seattle Storm, Dallas Wings

**Characteristics:**
- High three-point attempt rate (65%+ of FGA from rim or three)
- Multiple capable perimeter scorers
- Fast pace, transition-oriented
- Spacing creates driving lanes

**Aces Vulnerabilities:**
- Kierstan Bell (3rd percentile TS%) struggles if asked to create off the dribble
- Aaliyah Nye (10th percentile TS%) provides spacing on paper but limited conversion
- Bench units allow open three-point looks

**Recommended Adjustments:**
1. **Prioritize Perimeter Defense** — Jackie Young assignment on opponent's best guard (her elite two-way rating justifies this)
2. **Switch-Heavy Scheme** — Use lineups where all five can defend perimeter actions
3. **Close Out Aggressively** — Force contested mid-range jumpers (where Aces defense excels)
4. **Control Pace** — Slow the game down, limit opponent possessions, force half-court execution

---

### Style 3: Small Ball Teams
**Examples:** Connecticut Sun, Phoenix Mercury

**Characteristics:**
- Four-out offensive sets
- Positionless basketball with interchangeable wings
- Push pace relentlessly
- Exploit slow-footed bigs

**Aces Vulnerabilities:**
- Traditional lineups with Wilson at the 4 can be exploited in space
- Smith's perimeter defense (13th percentile STL%) is a liability against drive-and-kick offenses
- Pace advantage if Aces don't dictate tempo

**Recommended Adjustments:**
1. **Small Ball Blitz Response** — Wilson at the 5, four guards/wings around her (extend to 22-24 MPG in this configuration)
2. **Push Pace Relentlessly** — Exploit the Aces' own speed advantage when going small
3. **Wilson at Elbow/High Post** — Too quick for opponent small-ball centers
4. **Gray-Wilson Pick and Roll** — This combination exploits defensive switches better than any other pairing

---

### Style 4: Physical, Defensive-First Teams
**Examples:** Connecticut Sun, Atlanta Dream

**Characteristics:**
- Below-average offensive efficiency but elite defensive metrics
- Physical post defense, hard fouls
- Disruptive perimeter pressure
- Slow-paced, grind-it-out approach

**Aces Vulnerabilities:**
- Chelsea Gray's turnover rate increases against pressure (16th percentile TOV%)
- Lower-efficiency bench players struggle in half-court sets
- Frustration fouls when shots aren't falling

**Recommended Adjustments:**
1. **Patience in Half-Court** — Run clock, get quality shots, don't settle for first available look
2. **Ball Security Premium** — Pair Gray with Jewell Loyd (93rd percentile TOV%) to protect possessions
3. **Free Throw Hunting** — Attack the paint to get opponents in foul trouble; Wilson draws fouls at elite rate
4. **Mental Discipline** — Don't let physical play disrupt offensive rhythm; maintain composure

---

## Matchup-Specific Recommendations

### Individual Defensive Assignments

| Opponent Player Type | Primary Defender | Reasoning |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Elite scoring guard | Jackie Young | 100th percentile PER + elite two-way rating |
| Physical post scorer | A'ja Wilson | Anchor defense, rim protection, size match |
| Stretch big/shooter | Kierstan Bell | 93rd percentile 3PT rate (understands shooters) |
| Quick point guard | Chelsea Gray | Experience, IQ, positioning over athleticism |
| Secondary scorer | Jewell Loyd | Ball security specialist, won't give up easy buckets |

### Offensive Matchup Exploitation

| Opponent Weakness | Aces Exploitation | Key Players |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Weak interior defense | Feed Wilson post-ups, Smith offensive rebounds | Wilson (100th pctile PER), Smith (75th pctile BLK%) |
| Slow-footed bigs | Small Ball Blitz, pace push | Young (94th pctile TS%), Gray (89th pctile AST%) |
| Poor perimeter defense | Three-point hunting for Bell/Nye | Bell (93rd 3PT rate), Nye (98th 3PT rate) |
| Turnover prone guards | Full-court pressure, traps | Young, Loyd (both elite TOV%) |
| Foul trouble susceptible | Attack the paint, draw contact | Wilson, Young drawing fouls |

---

## Game Situation Adjustments

### Protecting a Lead (Up 10-20 points, 4th Quarter)

**Lineup:** Defensive Lockdown (Wilson, Young, Bell, Smith, Loyd)

**Strategy:**
- Slow pace significantly (milk clock to 18+ seconds)
- Limit possessions (each possession counts more for trailing team)
- Force tough twos instead of threes
- Protect defensive glass (eliminate second chances)
- Conservative offensive sets (high-percentage looks only)

---

### Trailing in Close Game (Down 5-10 points, Final 6 Minutes)

**Lineup:** Championship Closing (Wilson, Young, Gray, Bell, Smith) or Offensive Firepower (swap Smith for Loyd if more shooting needed)

**Strategy:**
- Push pace to create additional possessions
- High pick-and-roll with Gray/Wilson or Young/Wilson
- Attack paint to draw fouls and stop clock
- Full-court pressure after made baskets
- Trust elite players (Wilson, Young, Gray handle 80%+ of offensive touches)

---

### Opponent on a Run (8-0 or Larger)

**Immediate Response:**
1. Call timeout
2. Insert Offensive Firepower lineup (Wilson, Young, Gray, Loyd, Smith)
3. Match opponent intensity with scoring punch
4. If run continues (12-0+), switch to defensive priority lineup

**Mental Approach:**
- Defense creates offense — get stops first, then run
- Short memory on missed shots; next play mentality
- Trust the system; don't abandon what got you the lead

---

### Foul Trouble Management

**A'ja Wilson with 3+ Fouls (Before 4th Quarter):**
- Sit immediately; cannot risk 4th foul
- NaLyssa Smith extends minutes (26-28 MPG)
- Gray-Young pick-and-roll becomes primary offense
- Return at 10:00 mark in 4th quarter

**Jackie Young with 3+ Fouls:**
- Sit immediately; too valuable
- Jewell Loyd enters for defensive continuity
- Gray usage increases; Loyd spot-up role
- Return depends on timing (ideally final 8 minutes)

**Chelsea Gray with 4+ Fouls (and 4+ Turnovers):**
- Sit immediately if both conditions met
- Jackie Young becomes primary ball-handler (85th percentile AST% capable)
- Simplify offense; fewer reads required
- Return in final 4 minutes if only 4 fouls

---

## Tier-Based Opponent Scouting

### Tier 1: Championship Contenders (Maximum Preparation Required)

**Minnesota Lynx**
- *Threat Level:* Highest — Size, experience, depth
- *Key Counter:* Twin Towers (Wilson + Smith 20-22 MPG together)
- *Game Plan:* Dominate paint, control boards, limit second chances
- *Critical Metric:* If Aces win rebounding battle by 5+, win probability exceeds 75%

**New York Liberty**
- *Threat Level:* Very High — Balanced attack, championship experience
- *Key Counter:* Elite core trio 28-30 MPG together
- *Game Plan:* Maximize Wilson-Young-Gray minutes, wear down their depth
- *Critical Metric:* If core three net rating stays +10 or better, Aces favored

**Seattle Storm**
- *Threat Level:* High — Elite perimeter shooting
- *Key Counter:* Defensive Lockdown lineup extended minutes
- *Game Plan:* Contest all threes, force twos, protect paint
- *Critical Metric:* Hold Storm below 32% from three = likely victory

---

### Tier 2: Playoff Contenders (Standard Preparation)

**Connecticut Sun, Phoenix Mercury, Dallas Wings**
- *Key Counter:* Matchup-specific (see Style adjustments above)
- *Game Plan:* Execute systems, avoid turnovers, control tempo
- *Critical Metric:* Turnover differential of +3 or better = high win probability

---

### Tier 3: Manageable Opponents (Execute Fundamentals)

**Remaining Teams**
- *Game Plan:* Championship Closing lineup 24-26 MPG
- *Goal:* Win by 10-15, rest starters in 4th quarter
- *Critical Metric:* Don't play down to competition; establish dominance early

---

## Summary: Key Game Adjustment Principles

1. **Match Opponent Style** — Don't force your style; adapt lineup configurations to exploit weaknesses
2. **Protect Core Three** — Wilson, Young, Gray combined net rating is overwhelming; maximize their minutes together
3. **Manage Foul Trouble** — Stagger stars; never have both Wilson and Young on bench simultaneously
4. **Trust the Process** — When losing, don't abandon identity; the system works over 48 minutes
5. **Situational Awareness** — Late-game lineup decisions should prioritize defense when protecting lead, offense when trailing

---

### Data Processing Methods

#### Python Scripts

**1. Data Ingestion (`pull_wehoop_only.py`, `pbpstats_*.py`)**
- Loaded parquet files and JSON API responses
- Filtered to Las Vegas Aces games only
- Standardized column names across sources
- Handled missing values (NA → 0 for counting stats, NA → excluded for rate stats)

**2. Validation Checks (`validate_metrics.py`)**
- Cross-referenced 3 random games against ESPN box scores for accuracy
- Verified metric ranges against reasonable bounds:
  - TS%: 0.30 - 0.75 (flagged outliers)
  - USG%: 0.10 - 0.40 (flagged outliers)
  - Net Rating: -30 to +30 (flagged extremes)
- Confirmed player totals sum correctly across games
- Validated Four Factors calculations against published formulas

**3. Derived Metrics Calculation (`add_derived_metrics.py`)**

Twenty (20) derived metrics were calculated from base statistics:

| Metric | Formula | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Two-Way Rating | OffRtg - DefRtg | Overall player quality |
| Efficiency Score | TS% × USG% × 100 | Volume-adjusted efficiency |
| Offensive Load | USG% + (AST% × 0.5) | Total offensive responsibility |
| Playmaking Efficiency | AST% / (AST% + TOV_Ratio) | Clean playmaking rate |
| Defensive Impact | -drtg_diff | Defensive on/off impact (positive = good) |
| Offensive Impact | ortg_diff | Offensive on/off impact |
| Star Rating | 40% impact + 30% efficiency + 20% usage + 10% availability | Composite player value (0-100) |
| True Usage | USG% + (AST% × 0.33) | Scoring + playmaking touches |
| Impact Per 36 | net_rtg_diff × (36 / mpg) | Normalized impact metric |
| Win Contribution | (mpg / 48) × win_pct × 100 | Minutes-weighted winning |
| Rebounding Impact | REB% × mpg / 10 | Total rebounding contribution |
| Availability | games_count / max_games | Durability percentage |
| Minutes Leverage | mpg / 30 | Team reliance on player |
| Role Clarity | max(USG%, AST%, REB%) / sum(all three) | Specialization score |
| Versatility Score | 1 - role_clarity | Well-roundedness score |

**4. Percentile Calculations (`weighted_percentile_analysis.py`)**

Weighted positional percentiles were calculated using the following methodology:

```python
def weighted_percentile(x, w):
    """
    Returns values in [0,1] representing the weighted cumulative distribution 
    position of each x, weighted by w (typically total minutes played).
    
    Methodology:
    1. Handle NA values - set weights to 0 for NA observations
    2. Sort values in ascending order
    3. Calculate cumulative weights
    4. Percentile = cumulative_weight / total_weight
    """
    x = np.array(x, dtype=float)
    w = np.array(w, dtype=float)
    w = np.where(np.isnan(w), 0, w)
    
    x_na = np.isnan(x)
    x2 = x[~x_na]
    w2 = w[~x_na]
    
    ord_idx = np.argsort(x2)
    x_sorted = x2[ord_idx]
    w_sorted = w2[ord_idx]
    
    cw = np.cumsum(w_sorted)
    total_w = np.sum(w_sorted)
    p_sorted = cw / total_w
    
    result = np.full(len(x), np.nan)
    result[~x_na] = p_sorted[np.argsort(ord_idx)]
    
    return result
```

**Weighting Rationale:** Players with more minutes carry proportionally more influence on percentile thresholds. This prevents low-minute players from skewing the distribution and ensures percentile rankings reflect meaningful comparisons among players with similar playing time contexts.

**Position Group Consolidation:**
- Guards (G): G + G-F = 78 players
- Forwards (F): F + F-G = 48 players  
- Centers (C): C + C-F = 24 players
- Total: 150 players with 10+ MPG

**"Lower is Better" Handling:** For metrics where lower values indicate better performance (TOV%, Defensive Rating, PF), values were inverted before percentile calculation to ensure 90th percentile always means "better than 90% of players."

**5. Data Cleaning**
- Removed duplicate records (same game appearing multiple times)
- Standardized player names across sources (e.g., "A'ja Wilson" consistency)
- Merged wehoop player IDs with pbpstats player IDs using name matching
- Filtered dataset to players with 10+ minutes per game (150 of 184 total players)
- Recalculated rankings using only the filtered 150-player pool

---

### Data Quality Notes

**Strengths:**
- wehoop provides official WNBA statistics with high reliability
- pbpstats advanced metrics align with industry-standard calculations
- Cross-validation against ESPN confirmed data accuracy
- Weighted percentile methodology adapted from established basketball analytics pipeline

**Limitations:**
- Shot location data coordinates require projection assumptions for visualization
- On/off splits can be noisy with small sample sizes (addressed by filtering to 10+ MPG)
- Some pbpstats advanced metrics are proprietary calculations
- Player position designations occasionally inconsistent across sources

**Reproducibility:**
- All Python scripts included in project repository
- Raw data files archived in `data/raw/` directory
- Processing steps documented with inline comments
- Random seed set for any stochastic operations (none in current pipeline)
